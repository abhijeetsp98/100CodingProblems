# 100CodingProblems
In this repository I am going to work on improving my coding skills. I know the basic and now I am looking forward to become Intermediate coder. I will upload my progress daily so if you are interested in improving yours as well then feel free to join.

My strategy is pick a topic and start solving the standard questions of that topic first from geeksforgeeks and SPOJ after doing so I'll join the competitive coding plateform like codechef and codeforces.
1.Solve the fundamental question.
2.Question bank of SPOJ.
3.Join contests.
I'll take part in codechef contest as well side by side but don't expect to perform excellent form myself.
